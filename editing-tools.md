# Open Source Editing and Publishing Tools

- [Gummi](https://github.com/alexandervdm/gummi/blob/master/README.md)
    - The simple LaTeX editor
    - [Wiki](https://github.com/alexandervdm/gummi/wiki)
- [Pressbooks](http://pressbooks.com)
	- A book content management system which exports in multiple formats: ebooks, webbooks, print-ready PDF, and various XML flavours. [Pressbooks](http://pressbooks.com) is built on top of [WordPress Multisite](http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Multisite).
- [Verku](https://github.com/Merovex/verku)
    - Verku provides authors a free, ruby-based production toolchain for self-published paper and electronic books using Markdown and the [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) document preparation system. The code base borrows heavily from [Kitabu](https://github.com/fnando/kitabu), while replacing [Prince](http://princexml.com) as the PDF generator. Use of Prince as recommended in Kitabu appears to me to violate the Prince license, and Prince itself is too expensive.
